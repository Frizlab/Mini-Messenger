# Mini Messenger
Load the Facebook Messenger mobile website on an iPhone.

## Why?
On iPhone, the mobile version of Facebook Messenger is disabled and users are instructed
to download the Facebook Messenger native application.

This is all fun and all, but I personally hate the Messenger application. To bypass this
restriction, I wrote this small application which simply loads the mobile version of the
Facebook Messenger website.
